# Welcome to the Webscaper project!

## Overview

Since the beginning of COVID buying weights has been nearly impossible (for a reasonable price)! I want to search for in-stock alerts from websites, and when they arrive, send me an email. 

You might be asking... Why not just sign up for email alerts? Because there's no fun in that!

## Set up

The code will live in a function app on Azure, use KeyVault for secrets, and Sendgrid for emails once stock is back online.
