# Welcome to the Webscaper project!

## Overview

Since the beginning of COVID, buying weights has been nearly impossible (for a reasonable price)! I want to search for in-stock alerts from websites, and when they are available to buy, send an email. 

You might be asking... Why not just sign up for email alerts? Because there's no fun in that!
